**Wumpus Game**

This is an online version of the 1972 game "[Hunt the Wumpus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_the_Wumpus)", with in-game agent programming capabilities (but no server to store your changes - Sorry!).
This work has been inspired by the book [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/), which uses the Wumpus world in many of its examples.
